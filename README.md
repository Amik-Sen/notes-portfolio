# Hello 👋
My name is Amik 😁, I am a computer science enthusiast. 
I share my learning and understanding regarding various topics on my website:
https://amik-sen.github.io/notes-portfolio/

P.S. : I know it's a template,so don't go pointing it out 😬. I am using it because my main motive is to keep my notes in one place, share my learning with others and not showcase my skills as a developer (Though I am good developer 😛)!
